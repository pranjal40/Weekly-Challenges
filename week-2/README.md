## Problem Statements

### Q.1) Check if a number is Palindrome 
A number is said to be palindrome if the reverse of the number is equal to the original number.<br>
Write a program that checks whether a number entered by the user is a valid palindrome.

#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter a number: 323
323 is a palindrome number. 
```

```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter a number : 2268
2268 is not a palindrome number.
```

### Q.2) Reverse a String

Write a program that takes a string input from the user and prints its reverse.

#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter the string: Hello!
Reversed string: !olleH
```
---

### Q.3) Geometric Progression

Take the input of the first term, common ratio, the value of "n" and the number of terms to be printed, from the user, for a Geometric Progression.
Print the specified number of terms of the Progression and also print their sum upto the nth term, where "n" is input by the user. The value of "n" can be less than or equal to the number of terms to be printed.

#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter the first term: 2
Enter the common ratio: 3
Enter the number of terms to be printed: 5
Enter the number of terms to be summed up: 4
GP: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162
Sum upto nth term: 80
```

```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter the first term: 3
Enter the common ratio: 2
Enter the number of terms to be printed: 6
Enter the number of terms to be summed up: 6
GP: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96
Sum upto nth term: 189
```
