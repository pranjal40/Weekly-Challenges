## Problem Statements

### Q.1) Library Book Management System
A library wants an automated system to track overdue books and calculate late fines.

#### Rules:

1. The library allows users to borrow books for 14 days.
2. If a book is returned late, a fine is applied:
    - â‚¹5 per day for the first 7 days after the due date.
    - â‚¹10 per day beyond 7 days after the due date.
3. If the fine exceeds â‚¹100, a 10% penalty is added to the total fine.
4. The program should take the return date as input and calculate the fine accordingly.

#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter the number of days after the due date: 5  
Fine to be paid: â‚¹25 
```

```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter the number of days after the due date: 22  
Fine before penalty: â‚¹185
Final Fine after 10% penalty: â‚¹203.5
```

### Q.2) Space Counter

Take input of the string from the user. Count the total number of spaces in the input string.


#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter the string: We are members of the SuperSyntax group.
Number of spaces in the string: 6
```

```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter the string: We  are   members     of theSuperSyntax    group  .
Number of spaces in the string: 17
```

### Q.3) Geometric Progression

Take the input of the first term, common ratio, the value of "n" and the number of terms to be printed, from the user, for a Geometric Progression.
Print the specified number of terms of the Progression and also print their sum upto the nth term, where "n" is input by the user. The value of "n" can be less than or equal to the number of terms to be printed.

#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter the first term: 2
Enter the common ratio: 3
Enter the number of terms to be printed: 5
Enter the number of terms to be summed up: 4
GP: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162
Sum upto nth term: 80
```

```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter the first term: 3
Enter the common ratio: 2
Enter the number of terms to be printed: 6
Enter the number of terms to be summed up: 6
GP: 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96
Sum upto nth term: 189
```
