## Problem Statements

### Q.1) Q.1) Decimal to Binary
Write a program that takes user input for a number and prints its binary equivalent. Google to learn how we convert a number from decimal number system to binary number system and then make a code for it on your device. 
**DONT SEARCH UP OR LOOK AT THE ACTUAL CODE FOR THIS**.


#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter a number: 11
Binary equivalent of 11 is 1011.
```
```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter a number: 26
Binary equivalent of 26 is 11010.
```

### Q.2) Repeat Remover

Write a program that takes input of a string and the desired case (upper or lower) by the user. The programm should convert the string into the specified case and print the string after removing all the repeated letters. The code should also remove extra whitespaces if required.

#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter a string: Hi everyone. I am a coder.
Enter the desired case(U or L): L

Output:
hi evryon. am cd

``` 
```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter a string: Greetings  to... all fellow   programmers!!!
Enter the desired case(U or L): U

Output:
GRETINS O... AL FW PM!!!
```

### Q.3) Character in string

Write a program that takes a special character as input from the user and inserts the input character at the specified location in the string. The special character should only be input at appropriate postions, not between the letters of a word. Display the final string, making sure each special character is followed by a single whitespace. The next letter after a fullstop(.) or an exclamation mark(!) must also be made capital. If a special character is already present at the spceified location, replace it with the new one and make appropriate changes as mention above.

#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter a string: Hello world I am a machine.
Enter special character to be inserted: ,
Enter position in the string: 12

Output:
Hello world, I am a machine.
```
```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter a string: Hello friend! today    is a wonderful day, to travel with you!
Enter special character to be inserted: .
Enter position in the string: 13

Output:
Hello friend. Today is a wonderful day, to travel with you!
```
```plaintext
Example 3:
Enter a string: Hello world I am a machine.
Enter special character to be inserted: -
Enter position in the string: 10

Output:
Insertion of special chacters not allowed in between the letters of a word!
```

### Q.4) Pattern Printer

Write a program that takes user input for the height of a pyramid and prints the desired pyramid of numbers.

#### Examples:
```plaintext
Example 1:
Enter the desired height of pyramid: 5
         1
       2 3 4
     5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16
```
```plaintext
Example 2:
Enter the desired height of pyramid: 3
    1
  2 3 4
